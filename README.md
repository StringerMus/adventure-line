# Adventure Line
Adventure Line is an interacive program that has been inspired by the Choose Your Own Adventure series to encourage children reading by placing them them in the role of the main character and giving the player the power to influence the line of story and the outcome based on their decisions as the game requires the user's input to progress through a story. This objective fits really well with this type of game as it's an interactive text based program.

The target audience for Adventure Line would be young children - teens due to type of stories that would be available to play and the type of game that is likley to engage this age group. This audience will fit the demographic to target for the objective of using an interacive text based app to get them interested in reading.
